# Neural Networks -- Artificial and Biological Models

Neural networks in their beginnings have been inspired by their biological counterpart. Since then, their design has diverged from their inspiration. Their potential functional explanations of the brain have inspired attempts to reconcile both worlds.
This repository presents my Bachelor's Thesis. Unfortunately, the structure is a bit confusing for now. However, I will continue to work on this topic and presentation (either in this repository or at another place) will improve.
